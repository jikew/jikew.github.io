# #5 Film Genre

> Means "type" or "sort", in French

### Definition
- A concept applicable to literature and other forms of art/entertainment, TV, magazine, comics...
- Categorised based on similarities (set of stylistic criteria, identifying distinctive types of text), but since a film can share similarties with many other films, they can be categorised in many ways
- Limiting a film to a certain label can be reductive

### Advantages of the genre theory
- Helps us understand the audience's expectations about everything: motifs, camera, atmosphere, lighting, characters, clothing, make-up, mood, dialogue...
- Expectation allows for surprise, similiarity and difference
- Informs us of taste: to select those within our tastes
- A film must be similar enough to the codes and conventions that the audience get what they were expecting... however, it must also contain enough different and surprising elements to make it new and appealing.
	> every mission impossible film must have certain traits but also not be exactly the same
- Allows us to understand the creative limitations involved in production
- Jacque Derrida:"a text cannot belong to no genre" (1981:61)
- Roland Barthes argued that it is in relation to other texts within a genre, rather than our lived experience, that we make sense of certain events within a text
	> If we see an on screen murder, we can only compare it to other on screen murders
- Similar to the schema theory, which proposes that we have mental 'scripts' helping us to interpret familiar events in everyday life.

## Societally
- Created by the film industry and understood by the public
- have clear identities and rules, predictable development 
- transhistorical
- have ritual or ideological function

## Sub-genres
- romantic...
	- comedy
	- drama
	- adventure
	- horr
	- sci-fi
	- thriller...
- The list is endless... Combine for convenience!
- whatever's popular that's what you put out
> Harry Potter is a fantasy, coming-of-age, mystery, action, adventure, literary adaptation...

## Semiotics: Read the clues & signs
- every small detail can help us identify the genre, even just from a mise en scene!

> Despicable Me 3 (2017)
- animation
- action
- comedy

>Ex Machina (2014)
- Sci-fi
- Romance (?)

>The Babadook (2014)
- Horror

> The Villainess 恶女(2017)

- Thriller
- World cinema (non-english language)

## Genre Busting

- Some genres work perfectly together
- Romantic comedy, horror thriller, sci-fi horror, sci-fi action, thriller comedy, erotic thriller, sci-fi drama, historical drama, horror comedy, action adventure, action drama...
- However, studios sometimes mix genres which have not been historically put together, which can *confuse* the audience
> Cowboys and Aliens (Favreau, 2011)
- Western & sci-fi tropes are so concretised it is difficult to mix up!
- Brave move lol
- Star Wars: Mandelorian is kinda western space!

## Genre confusion: the musical
- The musical can be anything, anytime, anywhere
- **abstract** concept removed from reality
- challenges our sense of cinematic realism!
- Usually, the musical accompaniment comes from nowhere: from *outside* of the cinematic world
- However, the singing comes *within* the cinematic world, which is a violation of the rules of realism that govern many othe rgenres
- Dance and singing originates from mind and emotions of characters, outwardly expressing the inner feelings
- Subverts our understanding because arguably it is beyond our experience
- In the musical we are not in control
- Might even disrupt the chronology of the film
- Animated musical might be better as the audience is not thinking about realism as much!

> The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)

## Conclusion
- Genre is important: it informs our tates
- When analysing, one of the first things you should identify is the genre
- Once this is established, we are aware of the type of film we are watching
